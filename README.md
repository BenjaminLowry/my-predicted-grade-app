# myPredictedGrade

Welcome to the repository for 'myPredictedGrade'!

myPredicted grade is an iOS app that allows IB students to record the results of their assessments, allowing for a visual record to be kept. It also provides grade estimates based on the 2016 IB grade boundaries in order to motivate students to increase grades and let them know when they are on track. 

The app is currently in the middle of the development process, and will likely be ready for the distribution on the App Store in a few months. However, feel free to check out the source code.

The developer for myPredicted Grade is Benjamin Paul Lowry, a high school junior living in Hong Kong. You can get in touch with him at benjaminpaullowry.appdev@gmail.com.
